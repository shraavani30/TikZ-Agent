## ⚠️ Current Status & Known Issue

> The application is fully developed and functional, but currently experiencing **IBM Cloud quota exhaustion** under the free-tier plan.

### 🛑 Issue
- **Error**: `"instance_quota_exceeded"`
- **Cause**: IBM Watson Machine Learning free-tier quota exceeded for the current month.

### ✅ Temporary Workaround
1. Enter your diagram description and click **Generate Diagram**.
2. Copy the **generated TikZ code**.
3. Paste it into a LaTeX editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
4. Manually compile and export your diagram.

The full feature set (preview, editing, and download) will resume automatically when the quota resets at the beginning of the next month.
